With the arrival of media3 and for professional reasons, I have had to do a lot of research on the use of media3 for background audio playback using one of the different available services such as **MediaSessionService**, **MediaLibraryService** and **MediaBrowserService**. Also, I needed to display notifications on both the status bar and the lock screen.
